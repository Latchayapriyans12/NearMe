<p>
<b>Veeranam Lake</b> is a historic freshwater lake located in the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu, India. 
The lake was constructed during the reign of the Chola dynasty in the 10th century AD by Rajaditya Chola, 
the son of Parantaka Chola I, to provide a reliable water source for irrigation and drinking purposes. 
Stretching over 14 kilometers in length and up to 4 kilometers wide, Veeranam Lake was originally built to harness 
the water of the Kollidam River and support extensive agricultural activities in the region. The lake is still a vital resource today, 
supplying water to towns and cities, including Chennai. Veeranam Lake stands as a testament to the advanced engineering skills of the Cholas, 
their vision for sustainable water management, and their immense contribution to Tamil civilization.
